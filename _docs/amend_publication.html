            The application will allow you to enter any text as publication ID,
            but you should take care using consistent well-formatted IDs
            to ensure ITU OB database is in good shape.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Publication ID can include uppercase letters, numbers,
              and underscores.
            <li>
              If the publication is associated with an ITU recommendation,
              the ID should include recommendation code.
            <li>
              Here are some examples of well-formed publication IDs:
              <ul>
                <li><em>E212_MNC</em>
                <li><em>X121_DCC</em>
