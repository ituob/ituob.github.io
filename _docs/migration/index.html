<section class="intro">
  <p>
    Thank you for volunteering to help with the migration of ITU Operational Bulletin archives!
  </p>
</section>

<section class="overview">
  <h3>Migration process overview</h3>
  <p>
  The process involves locating a historical OB edition—available in the old format
  (MS Word and/or PDF) on ITU’s website—and using ITU OB Editor app to enter the data
  from that edition into the new data repository.

  <h3>Submitting your changes</h3>
  <p>
  You will configure your copy of ITU OB Editor app to operate on your individual copy
  of ITU OB data. Changes you make will go into that copy. After you make a few changes,
  you will request from the maintainers of ITU OB data repository to pull and review your changes.

  <h3>More about ITU Operational Bulletin</h3>

  <p>
  ITU Operational Bulletin (OB) is a publication used for exchange of information about changes
  in international telecommunication networks and services.

  <h4>Q: Why does ITU OB exist?</h4>

  <p>
  ITU maintains a number of Recommendations, which are the standards adhered to
  by telecommunications equipment used across the planet.

  (To draw a simplified analogy, a Recommendation is like an <em>addressing system</em>:
  each address has properties like a country name, city, street and building.)

  <p>
  Alongside each of those standards, ITU maintains various datasets that describe the specific details about
  each telecommunications provider who participates in the system.
  These datasets are distributed in the form of Service Publications.

  (To continue the above analogy, a Service Publication may be like an <em>address book</em>,
  describing how pieces of equipments can find one another.)

  <p>
  By following those Recommendations and Service Publications,
  telecommunication operators across the whole planet can interoperate with each other.
  This is how, for example, we can call any mobile phone number on the planet,
  even if that number is operated by a different company in another country.

  <p>
  Operational Bulletin aggregates changes to Recommendations and Service Publications,
  helping telecommunications operators and other participants to keep up-to-date with
  the latest state of affairs and avoid the breakdown of communications.

  <h4>Q: Why is it being migrated?</h4>

  <p>
  Historically, ITU Operation Bulletin has been a periodic publication,
  with a new issue coming out every couple of weeks.
  ITU staff would gather notices from various telecommunications providers,
  compile those changes together into a Microsoft Word document,
  and upload it to ITU website.

  <p>
  This solution is far from being efficient, and as part of a new program
  ITU OB is being migrated to a new structured format.
  This allows ITU OB issues in HTML, MS Word and PDF formats to be generated automatically,
  allows ITU to offer a machine-readable feed of OB messages.

  <h4>Q: How is ITU OB structured?</h4>

  <p>
  Each edition of Operational Bulletin contains the following.

  <ol>
    <li>
      A table of still-relevant Service Publication positions (also called <em>Annexed Lists</em>)
      that were previously annexed.
      This table doesn’t change very often.
    <li>
      A number of <em>messages</em>, split into two sections:

      <ol>
        <li>
          In “General Messages”,
          each message contains information related to some ITU recommendation.
          <br>
          Example messages: “Telephone Service”, “Service Restrictions”, etc.

        <li>
          In “Amendments”,
          each message contains changes made to a specific annexed service publication
          since the previous ITU OB edition came out.
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      Fresh Service Publication positions annexed to this issue, if any.
  </ol>
